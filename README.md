## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express

Full CRUD is ustilized in app. The database used was Mongo Atlas. Each page diplays object from database using arrays methods such as Map and Filter using User models and live api data. Auth was done by creating models of users and setting cookies and sessions. Personal coins were done by references User and Coin models.

## Optimizations
Allow additional coins and custom coins to be added and automatically searched with api. Allow users to store other data other than login and pre-selected list of coins.


## Lessons Learned:

When implementing live apis, its imperative to keep information clear and concise. Over complicating the data that is pulled from an api can make everything convoluted very quickly. Get the information that has previously been decided upon then improve after a working model is developed.
